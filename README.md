# Link-Scripts

This is a repo of Google Apps Scripts to interact with [Gem Pixel Premium URL Shortener](https://gempixel.com/products/premium-url-shortener) built in API.

[Get All Links and Clicks](https://github.com/jacobrosenfeld/Link-Scripts/blob/main/Get%20All%20Links%20and%20Clicks.js) will pull the last 500 links with the URL details and (most importantly) the number of clicks. I created this because the dashboard does not currently have a good way to export summary data of the clicks.
